Wordle Project

This Wordle Project was built as an assignment for one of my Computer Science Classes.

The project has two playable Wordle files, one is a normal version of the game Wordle using the same color scheme as the original game to provide hints and uses a random word from the words.py function. The second version is an easier version that informs the user how many possible words there are remaining and lists 5 random possible words given the known clues.

This function uses the display_utility file to display the colors for the wordle hints, this file was provided to us (and created) by our professor Daniel Kluver for this project.

The words list in the file words.py was taken fromhttps://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list and was modified by my professor Daniel Kluver for us to use for this project.
